The *leaflet* package is loaded for creating interactive maps. We need to set the seed. This is to improve the reproducibility of the code.

```{r}
library(leaflet)
set.seed(12345)
```

Here is the code to create an interactive map using *leaflet* with 500 random markers.

```{r message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="***Above is the interactive map created with 500 random markers.***"}
df <- data.frame(label = as.character(1:500),
                 lat = runif(500, min = 34.65, max = 34.75),
                 lng = runif(500, min = 135.45, max = 135.55),
                 stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

df %>%
    leaflet(width = "100%") %>%
    addTiles() %>%
    addMarkers(clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions(),
               popup = df$label)
```
